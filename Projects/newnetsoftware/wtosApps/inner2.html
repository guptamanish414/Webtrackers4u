<h1><p align="center"><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENT</strong></p></h1>
<h2><p align="justify">THIS AGREEMENT IS BETWEEN </p></h2>
<p align="justify">1.	NewNet Software &#45 the trading name of Committed Support Services Ltd (Registered Number: 187550869), whose registered office is at 86-90 Paul Street, London EC2A 4NE (&quot;NewNet Software&quot;); and </p>
<p align="justify">2.	The Client as defined below (&quot;the Client&quot;). </p>
<p align="justify">The parties have agreed that NewNet Software will provide the Client with IT design and development and other relevant services on the terms and conditions set out below. </p>
<h2><p align="justify"><strong>I. WEBSITE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT</strong></p></h2>
<p align="justify">A) SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </p>
<p align="justify">NewNet Software will: </p>
<p align="justify">1.	Liaise with the Client in developing the look and feel of the Website, Product and the agreed Service Proposal;</p>
<p align="justify">2.	Design, develop and deliver the Website in accordance with the agreed Proposal;</p>
<p align="justify">3.	Provide the relevant Services as agreed; and </p>
<p align="justify">4.	Provide at the request of the Client, Maintenance and Support Services. </p>
<p align="justify">B) CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES </p>
<p align="justify">The Client acknowledges that NewNet Software's ability to provide the agreed Services is dependent upon the full and timely co-operation of the Client (which the Client agrees to provide), together with the accuracy and completeness of any information and data the Client provides to NewNet Software. Accordingly, the Client will provide NewNet Software with access to and use of all relevant information, data and documentation as reasonably required by NewNet Software, to ensure the acceptable quality of performance by NewNet Software of its obligations under this agreement. </p>
<p align="justify">
  The Client will be responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the content Materials on the Website in accordance with the agreed Proposal. </p>
<p align="justify">NewNet software can provide website content, royalty free images, and specialist onsite photography for still photos and videos.</p>
<p align="justify">C) DEVELOPMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF WEBSITE </p>
<p align="justify">Once NewNet Software has completed the full consultation with the Client pursuant to the above clauses, NewNet Software will provide the Client with the relevant Proposal. The Client will indicate its approval of the Proposal by making an advance payment of a 30% (or negotiable) deposit of the total charges relating to the Services, as stated in the Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, such deposit is non-refundable. </p>
<p align="justify">Once the Client has approved the Proposal, NewNet Software will develop and produce the required Specification for the approval of the Client. </p>
<p align="justify">The Client will have a period of 10 business (working) days in which to consider the Specification and to submit written comments to NewNet Software. The parties will discuss any proposed amendments and will use their reasonable endeavours to agree the form of the Specification within 5 business (working) days. For the avoidance of doubt, if the proposed changes are material changes and affect the cost of development, NewNet Software will provide the Client with revised Service and Delivery Charges. </p>
<p align="justify">Where the Client fails to provide comments in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions, NewNet Software will, in its complete discretion, invoice the Client for any work done to date. Such invoices will be payable by the Client on receipt.</p>
<p align="justify">Once NewNet Software has completed the design and development of the Website, in accordance with the Proposal and the Specification, it will run the necessary Acceptance Tests. </p>
<p align="justify">The Acceptance Tests will test the compliance of the Website with the Website Specification. </p>
<p align="justify">Acceptance of the Website will occur when the Website has fully passed the required Acceptance Tests. NewNet Software will notify the Client, as soon as practical, when the tests have been passed and will confirm the results of the Acceptance Tests to the Client in writing. </p>
<p align="justify">Where there is any failure to pass the Acceptance Tests results from a defect which is caused by an act or omission of the Client or by one of the Client's sub-contractors or agents for which NewNet Software has no responsibility (&quot;Non-NewNet Software Defects&quot;), the Website will be deemed to have passed the Acceptance Tests notwithstanding such Non-NewNet Software Defect. NewNet Software will provide assistance, as reasonably requested by the Client, in remedying any Non-NewNet Software Defects by supplying additional services or products. If so requested, the Client will pay NewNet Software in full for all such additional services and products provided, at NewNet Software's then current fees and prices. </p>
<p align="justify">Acceptance of the Website will be deemed to have taken place upon the happening of any of the following events: 
  <li>
    <div align="justify"> the Client uses any part of the Website &quot;live&quot; (that is for any revenue-earning purposes or to provide any services to third parties other than for test purposes); </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the Client unreasonably delays the start of the relevant Acceptance Tests or any retest for a period of 7 business (working) days from the date when NewNet Software is ready to commence running the Acceptance Tests or retests; and/or</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the Client fails to inspect the Website, deemed Acceptance will occur 10 business (working) days from delivery of the Website to the Client.</div>
  </li>
  <div align="justify">
    </p>
  </div>
<p align="justify"> <br />
  D) THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS </p>
<p align="justify">The third party Products will be supplied in accordance with the relevant third party suppliers&#39; standard terms and NewNet Software will use its reasonable endeavours to pass on to the Client any such manufacturers guarantees. </p>
<p align="justify">Any third party Charges are included in the relevant Charges payable section as stated herein.</p>
<p align="justify">E) SUPPORT SERVICES </p>

  </p>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the identity and contact details of the author of the Fault Report; </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the nature of the Fault; and classification of the Fault </div>
  </li>
<p align="justify">  NewNet Software will thereupon promptly investigate the reported Fault to identify whether it is due to an error of NewNet Software or otherwise. Where the error and defect is due to the equipment or software not provided by NewNet Software, NewNet Software will notify the Client who will then obtain the necessary support from an alternative provider. Where the Fault is due to an error in the NewNet Software Product, NewNet Software will provide the necessary Support Services. </p>
<p align="justify">NewNet Software will provide the following Support Services to the Client during Business Hours in respect of the NewNet Software. Where Support Services are provided outside of Business Hours, NewNet Software has the option to charge the Client at its current rates: </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the remote rectification of Faults by the issue of fixes in respect of the NewNet Software Products; and </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the creation and dispatch to the Client, from time to time, at NewNet Software's sole discretion of Maintenance Releases. </div>
  </li>
<p align="justify">
  The Support Services will not include the diagnosis and rectification of a fault arising from: </p>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the improper use or neglect of any software or equipment; </div>

  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the failure by the Client to implement recommendations in respect of, or solutions to Faults previously notified to the Client by NewNet Software; </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">a repair, adjustment, alteration or modification of the NewNet Software Product by a third party, without the prior written authority of NewNet Software; and</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="justify">the use of the NewNet Software Product for a purpose for which it was not designed.</div>
  </li>
<p align="justify">F) CHARGES AND PAYMENT </p>
<p align="justify">The Client will pay 30% (or negotiable) of the total Charges relating to the Services as a non-refundable deposit, on the approval of the Proposal. </p>

<p align="justify">All Charges are exclusive of VAT. </p>

<h2><p align="justify"><strong>II.	APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT</strong></p></h2>
<p align="justify">All Software applications developed by NewNet Software have all Intellectual Property Rights in the Documentation and in the Website (including in the content of the Website and the Website Software), but excluding the Materials, arising in connection with this agreement will be the property of NewNet Software and NewNet Software hereby grants the Client a non-exclusive licence of such Intellectual Property Rights for the purposes of operating the Website. </p>
<h2><p align="justify"><strong>III.	SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></p></h2>
<p align="justify">  A) User Sign up Obligations</p>
<p align="justify">The Client user is required to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access or use the Services. Where the Client user represents an organisation and they wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, NewNet Software recommend that the Client, and all other users from the Client organisation, sign up for user accounts by providing their corporate contact information. In particular, NewNet Software recommends that the Client uses their corporate email address. The Client User agrees to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about themself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. Where any information provided by the Client user is deemed untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if NewNet Software has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, NewNet Software may terminate the Client user account and refuse current or future use of any or all of the Services.</p>
<p align="justify">B) Organisation Accounts and Administrators</p>
<p align="justify">  Where the Client signs up for an account for their organisation, they may specify one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on the Client&#39;s requirements and manage end users in their organisation&#39;s account. Where the organisation account is created and configured on the Client&#39;s behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for the Client organisation. It is the responsibility of the Client to make sure that they enter into a suitable agreement with such third party, specifying such party&#39;s roles and restrictions as an administrator of their organisation&#39;s account.</p>
<p align="justify">The Client is responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of their organisation&#39;s account password, ii) appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing their organisation&#39;s account, and iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with their organisation&#39;s account comply with this Agreement. The Client understands that NewNet Software is not responsible for account administration and internal management of the Services for the Client.</p>
<p align="justify">The Client is responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that their organisation does not lose control of the administrator accounts. The Client may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email to info@newnetsoftware.co.uk, provided that the process is acceptable to NewNet Software. In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, NewNet Software may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof, satisfactory to NewNet Software demonstrating authorisation to act on behalf of the organisation. The Client agrees not to hold NewNet Software liable for the consequences of any action taken by NewNet Software in good faith in this regard.</p>
<h2><p align="justify"><strong>IV.	MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT</strong></p></h2>
<p align="justify">A) The Parties have agreed the detailed Website Maintenance Specification as defined in the specific Document and Schedule of this Agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">Any amendments proposed to this Website Maintenance Specification must be made in writing and delivered to the other party. Either party is entitled to request a meeting to discuss such amendments.</p>

<li>Delivery</li>
<p align="justify">NewNet Software will deliver the completed Website Maintenance to the Client by way of Compact Disc, (CD) or such other data storage method as selected by NewNet Software.</p>
<li>
  <div align="justify">Where the Client requires the completed Website Maintenance to be loaded onto a fileserver using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), NewNet Software is entitled to make an additional reasonable charge for this service. The Client is responsible for ensuring that the intended fileserver or disk space on the fileserver is properly configured. NewNet Software will not load the completed Website Maintenance onto a publicly available fileserver or disk space on such a fileserver until the Client has complied with the conditions.</div>
</li>
<p align="justify">B) SOFTWARE UPDATES/UPGRADES. </p>

<p align="justify">(d) Installation of Updates and/or Upgrades. Where NewNet Software or Distributor installs Updates for the Client, the NewNet Software or Distributor may charge installation fees for such service.</p>
